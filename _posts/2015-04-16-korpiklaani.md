With the departure of winter I get very exited about new folk-metal releases.
There is little more summer-y than an enthusiastic accordion and a couple of
cheerful fiddles. And with the promise of sun, beer and back-to-the-nature
barbecues, it is comforting to know what I will be listening to while running
from sauna to the lake. Hence the assembling of Midsummer festival playlist
three months in advance.

Imagine the squeals of delight when the new release of Korpiklaani was
announced for May 5 (via Nuclear Blast). Although I am not a fangirl, for me
the sound of these Finnish booze-metal legends has become almost synonymous
with 'party'. You can always trust Korpiklaani to provide a perfect musical
backdrop to the post-bathhouse bonfire dance. They are one of the bands whose
albums sound delightfully similar. They work well in exuberant settings and
every consecutive release guarantees that you don't have to replay 'Vodka' an
obscene number of times (of this, I am, quite guilty). It is also the music
that my metal-illiterate friends can stomach.

One can hardly blame the band for permanently existing in a state of midsummer
madness. The ancient Finns believed the harvest to be proportional to the
amount of drink consumed and noise made during the festival (the more and
louder the better). Since Midsummer tradition in Finland still involves
traditional ways of spotting and attracting a potential spouse, the first song
from the upcoming "Noita" features none of the drinking and all of the implied
lovemaking. 

The word 'noita' translates from Finnish as 'witch', but more appropriately
meaning 'shaman'. Lempo, on the other hand, is the deity of fertility to whom
the Finns turned for help in bettering their sex lives. You can see the
direction this is heading.

The song is everything I expect from folk-metal. On top of the well known
riffs, Jonne is not so much singing as storytelling (which may suck if you
don't speak Finnish). The lively music has a well-hidden solemnity that comes
from a long history and subject matter deep-rooted in tradition. But above all,
it is hopeful, as even the violin appears to be pleading to Lempo.

Though Korpiklaani's 2012 record Manala was an attempt to step towards a more
serious tone, it is still danceable. In the long run it will take more than an
album to show that they are capable of more than beverage jingles, but Lempo is
positively adding to the list. And in the unlikely case that "Noita" ends up
disappointing, I will take advice from the Korpiklaani Handbook of Finland and
in place of naked lake gazing, chant for Lempo instead.
