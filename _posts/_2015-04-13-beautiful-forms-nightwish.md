The newest release by Finnish metal band **Nightwish** has a lot going for it.
As an outsider to the metal community, I was only vaguely aware of them. This
album has certainly made me pay more attention, and I'll be seeing them live
[this November](http://nightwish.com/en/live). So what made me convert? Let us see.

I don't really want to tell you the obvious, but I have to let you know that
I'm aware. Metal has a power to it that is hard to miss. Even after having
listened to the album on and off since its release, I still get an energy surge
every time I put it on. Obvious maybe to those better versed in the ways of metal,
but this is just fantastic to me.

What is interesting about Nightwish as opposed to other bands, is that this
power comes almost exclusively from a contrast between the symphonic parts and
female voice, and the underlying metal. Although no single part is very
powerful in isolation, it is this combination that makes the hairs on your back
question their existence.

Attention to detail is important. Then again, everyone knows this and it's not
a very interesting thing to say. That's why I'm saying the opposite: I love how
the band lets a bit loose on this album. Although the music is very polished,
there's some rough edges that translate to pure fun.

The most obvious are lead vocals by [Floor Jansen]. Apart from being simply fantastic,
they are 

More than attention to detail, this fun translates to a great listening experience.
It also gives me confidence that they'll do great live. This is perhaps the most
reassuring thing to come out of this release: despite politics, switching out band
members and high expectations, Nightwish can deliver great music.
